# To do app

I am working on this project for the purpose of learning angular. As of now, the project does not make use of any styling and it is just angular.

I decided to create this on my own after taking the "Angular Essential Training" course on linkedIn learning.

I am hoping to turn this into a full fledged To do app as I learn more on my path to becoming a MEAN stack developer.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
